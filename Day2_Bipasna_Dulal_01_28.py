#List of Variables:
#There are two types of variables:
# 1- Local Variable
# 2- Global variable

#int (signed integers)= Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
#Int is immutable.

#float (floating point real values)= Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
#Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
#Float is immutable.

#complex (complex numbers)= Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.
# Complex is immutable.

#string= Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
#'hello' is the same as "hello".
#Strings are immutable.

#list= Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. Lits are mutable.

#tuple= Tuples are the ordered sequence of the items. Tuples are immutable.

#dictionary are the standard data types of python's variable. Dict are mutable.

#Set= Sets are an unordered collection of items. Every element is unique.
#sets are mutable.


#examples of string:

a= "apple"
print(a, type(a))

A= "Amy Jackson"
print(A, type(A))

miles= "Hundred miles"
print(miles, type(miles))

name= "Bipasna"
print(name, type(name))

first_place= "Nepalgunj"
print(first_place, type(first_place))


#examples of list:

x= [1, 'value', 'w']
print(x, type(x))

nameofanimals = ['monkey', 'donkey', 'dog', 'cat',]
print(nameofanimals, type(nameofanimals))

numbers= [1, 2, 3.0, 20]
print(numbers, type(numbers))

name_of_girls= ["Sita", "Anu", "Garima", "Lochan", "Abina"]
print(name_of_girls, type(name_of_girls))

y= [5, 'hi', 3+5j]
print(y, type(y))
